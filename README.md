# Surfs_up

## Background
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Overview
The project explores how to efficently produce an analyis of temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii by using Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval. The investor wants to open a business in Oahu, Hawaii but is worried that the weather will cause the shop to close too frequently. The ice cream shop has called for a summary of the statictics for months June and December. They want to determine if they can make a switch from a seasonal business to a business that can operate all year round.

#### Key Points

- The mean temperature for June (75 Degrees) is slightly higher from Decembers (72 degrees) but is not too far apart in difference which is a positive thing. It's only a 5 persent change in average temperature.

- Although you might think because June is the summer season precipitation would be higher, but it is far from true. December has a higher rate in precipitation than the month of June.

- June seems to have a more predictable outcome of temperature for the season. December is a little more rocky when is comes to the temperature although it still rises and drops in the same direction like the moonth of June.

- December has a larger range in temperature changes then June given its larger range in temperature recordings.
